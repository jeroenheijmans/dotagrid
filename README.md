# DotaGrid
DotaGrid is a simple little app to create hero layouts for the game Dota 2. Choose from a few basic templates, or create your own custom grid, and then load it up in Dota.

# Warning
**This project is no longer under active development.** It *might* get updated with new heroes once in a while, and probably not frequently nor promptly - no promises though. Feel free to fork the app and continue development, as per the MIT license!

Note that this app is an **ad hoc solution** with no spec, unit tests, or up-front design, and it was created for personal use, made public just in case someone else may find it useful too. Please don't expect active support or regular updates, but feel free to build upon this source!
